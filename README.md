# Money-Ball-On_Base_Percentage
Code, data, and Results of Analysis made for Hakes and Sauer about the effects of the changes of the hire on Baseball by the insights published in Money Ball. This code was made during the course Sports Performance Analytics (University of Michigan, Coursera).

The publication of *Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game* by Michael Lewis in 2003 is widely credited with the data analytics revolution in baseball and sports in general.  

There was data analysis in sports before Moneyball, but only after Moneyball were teams, and the public more broadly, convinced that data analysis could be used to improve sporting performance.  

The specific claim of Moneyball was quite subtle, and the arguments went like this:  
    
>Billy Beane, the General Manager of the cash-strapped Oakland A's recognized that teams reward batters for their hitting ability, measured by statistics such as **Slugging Percentage** (SLG), but did not reward them for the capacity to draw walks. But a walk is no different from a hit that gets you to first base. By hiring players who were good at drawing walks, The A's could run a better team than you would expect given their finances.
        
This amounts to saying that the market for players was inefficient, since the skills of certain players were being undervalued. It was as if some teams left hundred dollar bills lying on the sidewalk.  

Moneyball had  an immediate impact on baseball teams, who quickly hired statisticians to help them search for the missing value.

Two economists, Jahn Hakes and Skip Sauer, realized that this story was capable of being tested. If the Moneyball story is true, then is should be the case that:  
    
>1. Before the publication of the book, the skill of drawing walks (which can be captured by the statistic **On-Base Percentage** (OBP)) should contributed to winning, but not be reflected in player salaries
>2. After publication, players with high OBP should be better rewarded.
        
Their paper *An Economic Evaluation of the Moneyball Hypothesis* used data to test these arguments and found that these claims were indeed supported by the data.
